### ✨ [See it in action on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/athano)

Welcome to our Twitch Bot!

This bot is intended for self-hosting streamers. Its adaptation for other channels is not covered in this project.

For Twitch API help, visit https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/.

This bot assumes users have programming experience. Please keep in mind that this project may not meet the needs of all users, but it does offer the ability to create a customized Twitch Bot.

We used Twitch's example at https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/example-bot as a starting point. Thanks, Twitch!

## Setup
[View SETUP instructions](./docs/SETUP.md)


## Configuration
[View CONFIGURATION instructions](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

## Start the bot

Client for Chat, Tasks and Spotify overlays:

```sh
cd client
npm start
```

Server:

```sh
cd server
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

Primarily, watch the console output for errors to troubleshoot issues.

For tokens that are saved in tokens.json (Twitch and Spotify), if you change your scope and there are already `access_token` and `refresh_token` present in the file, you should remove these token values. Once you have your new access code the program will retrieve a new `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
